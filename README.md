# Alarm Clock App

## Introduction

This is an Alarm Clock application created using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS

## How to use

The alarm clock is pretty straight forward, the clock displays the current time.

You use the drop down menu to select the hour and minute you wish to set the alarm at.

You click the add alarm button to add the alarm.

Once you have set an alarm, the Alarm Not Currently Set text will update to show what time you have set the alarm for.

Once the clock reaches the time the alarm is set for, the alarm will ring for 1 minute.

You can click on disable alarm before the time is reached to disable the alarm, or whilst the alarm is playing to stop the alarm playing.
